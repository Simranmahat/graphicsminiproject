For this project, we will primarily utilize Python, a versatile and widely used programming language, along with OpenGL (Open Graphics Library), a cross-language,cross-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D
vector graphics. Additionally, we may leverage supplementary libraries such asPygame for user input handling and PyOpenGL for interfacing with OpenGL withinPython
